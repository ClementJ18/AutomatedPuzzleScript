\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
When I first started on this project I was not sure where I was going. I knew I wanted to do something with video games, which have always been a personal interest of mine both from an entertainment perspective and a research perspective. 

There was an idea that slowly evolved, helped by the work of others, feedback from those around me and my own tinkering. This project has been one of the biggest undertakings of my life and I would not have managed to finish it if not for the support of my peers.

I am very grateful for the help of my supervisor, Riemer van Rozen, for pushing me into this project when I first approached him. He helped me understand what I wanted from my master project and helped me shape a project that met these desires. He met with me every week, sometimes more, for nearly a year, always asking the hard questions that forced me to leave no stone unturned.

I want to thank my family, and especially my mother who, without knowing anything about meta-programming, never stopped asking me questions on my work in an unorthodox variant of rubber ducking.

I also want to thank Georgia Samaritaki and Youri Reijne, the two other students supervised by Riemer. Their feedback when we discussed our projects was very helpful.

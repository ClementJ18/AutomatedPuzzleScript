# Automated PuzzleScript


## Current Shortcomings
* Parsing comments at the end of the file causes a parse error

## Current WIP

## Concessions
* Only the default palette is available, adding multiple palette is trivial but tedious
* Sounds not checked or played, probably trivial, not very interesting from this project's point of view
